Hi there,

Thanks for contacting GitLab Support.

As of 2020-08-15 GitLab Support is no longer processing requests to disable two-factor authentication for free accounts that do not have a GitLab.com subscription, to safeguard the security of our users. For more information about this change please see our post on the GitLab Blog.

If you believe this response was sent in error and you already hold a GitLab.com subscription, we apologize for any inconvenience caused.

To assist you further, we need to ensure that support requests come from a named contact within your organization. Please contact an existing named support contact to submit the request on your behalf. Alternatively, you can review our guide on proving your support entitlement and submit a ticket with our Support Operations team to be added as a named contact before subsequently opening a new ticket.

For more information on our support policies and the community-driven support resources available to you, please see our statement of support.

If you're interested in purchasing a subscription, please see the pricing page for information on pricing, features, and support response times for each subscription level. You can also contact our sales team.

To assist as much as is possible, we have included some self-serve options you can use to recover your account:

    Use a saved recovery code
    Generate a new recovery code using SSH
    Group Owners can disable 2FA for Enterprise Users

This ticket will now be automatically closed. Thank you for your understanding.
