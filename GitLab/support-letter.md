 # GITLAB TICKET NUMBER #627833

Please Help, 

 

* I understand that unpaid users don't get to submit tickets, but I have tried everything I have read in the documents about 2fa recovery. I have been trying for months! I seriously need a little leniency.

* My email is linked to the account that I can not access, either I need the 2fa reset or account deletion, I am willing for either. I had just set the account up before the lost phone issue, I did not think to save the backup codes on a cloud or another device, and I had just started using Google Authenticator app, but had not set it up on GitLab yet.

* I also have my GitHub linked to the locked account, I tried making an new account using my hotmail address and my name “BradfordAdams” vs my known screen name “Bradford1040”. I have been using the Bradford1040 screen name for many years, believe since 2003, So maybe you can understand my will to have the ability to use it again and link GitLab back with GitHub. 

* I wish to start using GitLab over GitHub and having my main email address is very important to me, which is my Gmail account, which is linked to my Google Cloud Console, Firebase Console & Studio, and Google AI Studio, as well as my Android studio. Almost everything development wise is linked to my GMAIL address, I was going to cancel my HOTMAIL, as it has been leaked in data breaches multiple times and constantly bombarded with people attempting to hack it!
